Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
vulnerability associated with the processing of MySQL authentication.

Detailed Information:
There are two vulnerabilities associated with MySQL password 
authentication.  The first vulnerability may permit an unauthorized
user access to the server if an attacker knows an authorized user name
and crafts a malicious client password hash. The second vulnerability
may cause a denial of service or buffer overflow if an attacker knows
an authorized user name and crafts an overly long password hash.

Affected Systems:
  MySQL 4.1.x prior to 4.1.3 and early builds of MySQL 5.0.0.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker who knows an authorized user name to a vulnerable server
can craft a password hash that permits unauthorized access or causes a
DoS or buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. 

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
