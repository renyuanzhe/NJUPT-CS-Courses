--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with Computer Associates License
software.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow of the host and
the subsequent execution of arbitrary code.

--
Detailed Information:
Computer Associates License software allows a site to maintain and
handle licenses for CA products.  A server runs the software to
facilitate this and it communicates with clients/agents on the
network. A vulnerability exists in some GCR messages that exchange
data with a listening server or client.

The GCR NETWORK and CHECKSUMS messages allocate fixed-sized buffers
for some of the values supplied to it.  No validation is performed
by the receiving host to ensure that the data received fits in the
allocated buffer(s).  If the received data cannot fit in the buffer,
an overflow occurs and execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable
host is possible.

--
Affected Systems:
	CA License 1.0.15, 1.53-57, 1.60, 1.60.2, 1.60.3, 1.61, 1.61.1, 1.61.2,
              1.61.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a GCR message with overly long data, causing
a buffer overflow on the vulnerable listening CA License server or
client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
