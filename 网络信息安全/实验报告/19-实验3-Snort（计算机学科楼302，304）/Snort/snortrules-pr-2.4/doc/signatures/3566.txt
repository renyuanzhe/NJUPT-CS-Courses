Rule:

--
Sid:
3566

--
Summary:
This rule should not generate an event.

--
Impact:
Execution of arbitrary code leading to full administrator access of the 
machine. Denial of Service (DoS).

--
Detailed Information:
When an attempt is made to bind to the Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)
system over a network connection, this rule sets a flowbit parameter for
use in other rules.

A programming error in the MSMQ subsystem may present an attacker with
the opportunity to overflow a fixed length buffer and execute code of
their choosing on an affected host.

This rule should not generate an event.
