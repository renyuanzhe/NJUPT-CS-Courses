--
Sid:
3637

--
Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
directory traversal associated with Computer Associates License
software.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can allow arbitrary files to be written or
existing files to be overwritten on a vulnerable host.

--
Detailed Information:
Computer Associates License software allows a site to maintain and
handle licenses for CA products.  A server runs the software to
facilitate this and it communicates with clients/agents on the
network. A vulnerability exists in the PUTOLF message that exchanges
data with a listening server or client.

The PUTOLF allows a file to be written to the target host.  However,
no validation is performed to look for a directory traversal outside
of the authorized directory.  This may permit new files to be uploaded
or existing files to be overwritten on the target host.

--
Affected Systems:
CA License 1.0.15, 1.53-57, 1.60, 1.60.2, 1.60.3, 1.61, 1.61.1, 1.61.2,
           1.61.8

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can craft a PUTOLF message that contains directory traversal
characters in the filename.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to the most current non-affected version of the product.
