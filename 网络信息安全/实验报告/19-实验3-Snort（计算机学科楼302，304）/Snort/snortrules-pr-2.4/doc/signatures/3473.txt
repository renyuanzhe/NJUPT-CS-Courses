Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
buffer overflow associated with RealPlayer handling of
Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) files.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a buffer overflow of the client
host and the subsequent execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
The RealPlayer media player can read SMIL formatted files.
SMIL provides a standard language for playing media clips.
A SMIL file can have a system-screen-size attribute that
supplies a value for the screen height and width.  A
fixed-sized buffer is allocated for the value supplied
to this attribute, however there is no check to ensure that
the supplied value fits in the allocated buffer.  A
buffer overflow occurs when the length of the supplied value
is greater than the fixed-size buffer.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect
should be configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP
server response traffic is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
