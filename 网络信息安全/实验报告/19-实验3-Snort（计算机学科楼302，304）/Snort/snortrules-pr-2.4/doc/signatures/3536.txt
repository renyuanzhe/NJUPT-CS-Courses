Summary:
This event is generated when an attempt is made to exploit a
heap overflow associated with Mozilla's processing of a
malformed GIF file.

--
Impact:
A successful attack can cause a heap overflow on the client host
running Mozilla and permit execution of arbitrary code at the
privilege level of the current user.

--
Detailed Information:
The Mozilla browser can read images from a file formatted in
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The GIF format has optional
"extension blocks" that supply additional information to a
browser that can interpret and render it.

An optional application block is one type of extension block.
There is a vulnerability with particular sub-blocks associated
with the application block that permits a signed variable that
should contain a positive value to be treated as a negative
number.  This may cause a heap overflow.

In order to avoid potential evasion techniques, http_inspect
should be configured with "flow_depth 0" so that all HTTP
server response traffic is inspected.

WARNING
Setting flow_depth 0 will cause performance problems in some situations.
WARNING

Affected Systems:
	Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird 1.0.1 and prior
	Mozilla browser 1.7.5 and prior

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker can entice a user to download a malicious GIF file
that causes an overflow, enabling execution of arbitrary code
on a vulnerable client.

--
Ease of Attack:
Simple. Exploit code is available.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
A malicious value found in any sub-block but the first will
